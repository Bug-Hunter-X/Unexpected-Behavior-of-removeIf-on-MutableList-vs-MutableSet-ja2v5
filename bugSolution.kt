The unexpected behavior stems from the inherent differences in how lists and sets are implemented.  Lists maintain order and allow duplicate elements while sets do not.  The solution is to understand this difference and use appropriate data structures and algorithms.

No code changes are needed to 'fix' the bug, however it is crucial to be aware of the functional difference.  For consistent behavior or if concurrent modification is a concern, consider using a copy of the set and iterating over the copy to remove items:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val set = mutableSetOf<Int>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val setCopy = set.toMutableSet() // Create a copy to avoid ConcurrentModificationException
    setCopy.removeIf { it > 2 }
    println(setCopy) // Output: [1, 2]
    println(set) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] original set unchanged
}
```

This approach preserves the original set while enabling safe removal operations. Alternatively, if you want to modify the original set use a standard for loop or use an iterator with its remove function.

Choosing between `MutableList` and `MutableSet` depends on your specific requirements.  If order and duplicate elements are important, use a `MutableList`.  If uniqueness is paramount, use a `MutableSet`.
